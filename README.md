# Jupyter FastAPI

**A Jupyter Server implementation using FastAPI.**

Warning! Very experimental!

I've only implemented the `GET` request from the `api/contents` REST API as a proof of concept.  

## Install

```
git clone 
cd jupyter_fastapi
pip install -e .
```

## Test it out!

Run on the command line
```
jupyter fastapi
```
