# Jupyter FastAPI

**A Jupyter Server implementation using FastAPI.**

Warning! Very experimental!

Right now, I've only implemented Jupyter's Contents REST API as a proof-of-concept.

## Install

```
git clone 
cd jupyter_fastapi
pip install -e .
```

## Test it out!

After installing, run the application by calling:
```
jupyter fastapi
```
